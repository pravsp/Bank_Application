# The code is integrated with gtest suite and can execute unit test with gtest

# Build can be triggered in 2 ways

    1. Bazel Build
    2. cmake Build

Bazel Build
------------
Follow the below steps to build using bazel build
STEP1: Clone the workspace
STEP2: Get into the workspace
STEP3: Clean any existing build using the below command
    `bazel clean --expunge`
STEP4: Trigger the Bazel test as follows
    `bazel test //test/banking_lib:bank_oper_test`
    `bazel test //test/utilities:utilities_tests`
                    (or)
    `bazel test -s //test/banking_lib:bank_oper_test`
    `bazel test -s //test/utilities:utilities_tests`
    # Use -s option only to enable verbose mode of commands used by bazel

The above steps will trigger the test using the gtest suite along with results

STEP5: Trigger the application build as follows
    `bazel build //app:banking-app -c dbg`
STEP6: Application can be executed as follows from workspace
    `./bazel-bin/app/banking-app`

NOTE: While using Bazel build Gtest suite is being compiled locally. Raised the following git issue
https://github.com/google/googletest/issues/2617

Cmake Build
-----------
Follow the below steps to build using cmake build

STEP1: Clone the workspace
STEP2: Get into the workspace
STEP3: Create your new build directory
STEP4: Get into the build directory
STEP5: Issue the cmake command
    `cmake ../`
STEP6: Once the cmake is complete issue the make command
    `make`
STEP7: This would build your environment and an application is built using gtest suite
STEP8: This would create a lib folder in workspace and bin folder in workspace
STEP9: Template library will be created in <workspace>/lib folder
STEP10: Test application will be created in <workspace>/bin folder
